# Introduction

This project is a representation of e-commerce application to demonstrate the concepts of object orientation using C# and windows forms as GUI.
The application features a main menu with options to use buyer portal, admin portal and a seller portal. Using these different portions users can buy, sell and manage different products. The game environment, including the main menu, buttons were created by using windows forms in Visual Studio.

# Overview
This management system was developed to demonstrate the concepts of OOP including

#### Class
A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have.

#### Object
An instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that is created using the class blueprint.

#### Encapsulation
The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. Encapsulation also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.

#### Abstraction
The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. This is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces.

#### Inheritance
The mechanism by which one class (the child or subclass) can inherit the attributes and methods of another class (the parent or superclass). Inheritance promotes code reusability.

#### Polymorphism
The ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. There are two types of polymorphism:

    Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading): Multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters.
    
    Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding): A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

#### Constructor
A special method that is automatically called when an object is instantiated. It is used to initialize the object.

#### Destructor
A special method that is automatically called when an object is destroyed. It is used to clean up resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime.
